# Phising_URL_web_application
Developed using flask framework. 
By taking two Kaggle datasets. 
Dataset 1 : https://www.kaggle.com/code/eswarchandt/website-phishing/data

Dataset 2 : 

Phishing attacks have become a major threat to internet users worldwide. Phishing attacks may occur in different areas
such as online payment, webmail, financial institutions, file hosting or cloud storage, etc. The main aim of this project is
to design an application to detect phishing websites using machine learning techniques by extracting the various features
from the URLs to train classifiers that can distinguish between legitimate and phishing URLs.

These techniques are also proposed to detect the network intrusions of phishing websites. Five algorithms such as SVM,
Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, Decision tree, and Random Forest are considered to compare for high accuracy.
The performance of Gradient Boosting is observed to be faster and more accurate comparatively. Network and system
security is of paramount importance in the present data communication environment. The main function of an Intrusion
detection system is to protect the resources from threats. It analyzes and predicts the behavior of users, and then these
behaviors are classified as normal behavior or attack.
